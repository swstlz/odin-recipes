    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This classic Margherita Pizza features a perfect blend of fresh basil, melted mozzarella cheese, and tangy tomato sauce atop a crispy, thin crust. Revered for its simplicity, this Neapolitan pizza pays homage to the colors of the Italian flag: green, white, and red. Baking at a high temperature ensures the crust chars just the right amount, akin to a traditional wood-fired pizza oven. Perfect for a quick dinner or a cozy gathering, this pizza promises a burst of flavors in every bite.</p>
