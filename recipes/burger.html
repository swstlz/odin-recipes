    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Smashburger recipes have revolutionized the burger scene with their unique cooking technique that results in irresistibly crispy edges and a juicy center. The key to a perfect smashburger lies in pressing a ball of ground beef onto a hot skillet or griddle with a heavy spatula, creating a thin patty that cooks quickly and develops a deliciously charred crust. Seasonings are simple, typically just salt and pepper, allowing the flavor of the beef to shine. Variations might include different types of cheese, such as American for classic gooeyness or sharp cheddar for a bolder taste. Toppings can range from traditional lettuce, tomato, and onion to more gourmet options like avocado, bacon, or a fried egg. The result is a delectable burger that's flavorful, with a satisfying texture contrast between the crispy exterior and tender interior.</p>
